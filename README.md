I am planning on creating a website that lists the top 10 artists in the United States. I will be getting my data from a Spotify database. I will create sections for each artists displaying all their album titles. When you click on the album, all the songs in the album and the song length will be listed. Users can also fill in the date the album was released and other artists featured in the album, if applicable. 

My 6 data models include:
1. Top 10 artists in the United States
2. Album by artist
3. Record label company
4. Date Created
5. Number of streams
6. Other artists featured in album

Users who visit the page can upvote the top 10 artists listed on the website. There will be a separate statistic based on the votes by the users on the page. I will create a side-by-side comparison of the user artist favorites and the artists ranked by number of streams on Spotify. My graphic will be a pie chart comparing the two categories with the artists names listed on the right and left side and 1-10 numbers in the middle.
