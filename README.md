My project will be about the University of Michigan Museum of Art. General users on the website can see what events are happening at UMMA. There will be a description of the event and a photo relating to the event. Users can mark whether they are interested or going. The people working at the museum can get a general idea of how many guest to expect. Users who are labeled under "curator" can add events to the page. 
Each event will be separated into categories such as Student Events, Family, Exhibition, etc.
